This implementation is to understand practical applications of genetic algorithms and their use with neural networks in
real-time simulated environments. This program aims to simulate agent behaviour and goal reward optimization.

There are two applications that will be experimented with:
-> voxel space simulation - group agent problem solving
-> smart message filtering - determining message quality to detect fraudulent or damaged data.
